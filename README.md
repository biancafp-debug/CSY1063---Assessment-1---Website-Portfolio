# CSY1063---Assessment-1---Website-Portfolio

Title: Assignment 1 

Overview: 

This assignment requires you to complete a web development project individually, which involves 
designing, developing, and demonstrating a portfolio website. The portfolio must contain a minimum 
of five pages, each serving a specific purpose, with a consistent, responsive design throughout. 
You are tasked with developing a portfolio site with at least five pages: 
1. index.html (home page) the first page is the home page which introduces the site’s it 
introduces the site’s purpose (portfolio), it could have a brief bio, tagline, welcome (like “Hi, I’m 
John” or the purpose of the site. 
2. project.html (project page) this page will contain placeholder images that will eventually be 
replaced with your work from term 2 and other modules where you make things worthy of 
your portfolio. You need to use a different grid layout from the rest of your pages to 
demonstrate your skill. 
3. contact.html (Contact page) this page will contain your contact information and a form. Note: 
For CSY1063 you make the form launch the user’s email program. Although this is not strictly 
the best way of working, you won’t be able to implement a better solution as that requires a 
server-side language such as PHP which we will not use in this module. 
4. videoDemo.html (Video demonstration page) this page will act as your video demonstration, 
you need to either use an iframe and have your video displayed on the page or show a URL 
that directs the user to your video demonstration. Failure to include a video demonstration 
will result in a capped grade. 
5. report.html 
• The report (250 word minimum) will contain your experience of learning the basics of 
web development, coding, design and debugging process. This should be a log or an 
informal conversation explaining your development experience. Include your ups and 
downs! 
• A ‘reflective discussion of your module experience’ 
• You will set out in the report the development of the site over the term and focus on 
both the technical and design of sites user interface (UI).  
• Explain the design decisions you made, how you chose the font/colours and link to any 
sites which influenced your website’s design. 
• On this page, include screenshots of validation reports showing that your pages HTML 
and CSS validate 
• Include the URL to your video demonstration in your report (Media Space or YouTube) 
Each page should be linked through a navigation menu, with consistent design across all pages. The 
website must be responsive, ensuring proper functionality on both desktop and mobile devices. 
You should ensure that you use the correct tags where appropriate. You will lose marks for using <div 
class=”nav”> instead of the correct <nav> tag!
